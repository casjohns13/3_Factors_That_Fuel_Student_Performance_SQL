# 3. SQL Project: Factors that Fuel Student Performance
How can students improve their exam performance? In this intermediate SQL querying project, you will analyze a database containing comprehensive data on various factors influencing student success, such as study habits, sleep patterns, parental involvement, and access to resources.
Through SQL queries, you will investigate which factors have the greatest impact on high exam scores, explore whether students who participate in more extracurricular activities perform better, and ascertain the influence of sleep on academic achievement. By the end, you will have a data-driven understanding of the drivers of student success, enabling you to make informed decisions for academic improvement.
